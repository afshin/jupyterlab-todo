## Jupyter Notify

A notification system for JupyterLab
 
Would you like to have customizable notifications from notebooks and other extensions while working inside JupyterLab? Well, now you can! Jupyter Notify provides a notification system for JupyterLab that includes the ability for extensions to send notifications to users as well as a platform where users can get back to past notifications.
 
Notifications are often seen as an annoyance to users because they don’t want to be constantly reminded of trivial updates. However, without a notification system in place there is no way for users to be aware of updates from the app. Currently, there is no notification system in JupyterLab. Today, users need to go into each of their Jupyter notebooks and manually check to find relevant events or updates by collaborators. Also, JupyterLab extensions can’t communicate with their users across tabs or applications to provide relevant updates like cell execution in notebooks.
 
JupyterLab Notify provides the ability for any extension in JupyterLab to send notifications to users. Notifications will present themselves for a set timeframe, but they can also be manually dismissed to ensure they won’t hinder the user’s view. Notifications contain information to call users to action, inform them of system updates, and other announcements, thus further establishing a collaborative environment among JupyterLab users. Jupyter’s Notify extension makes it possible for all collaborators to receive a visible notification of their progress. This improved notification system will support passive pop-up toast-style notifications. However, users can customize the settings to control notifications to either pop-up with toast notifications or go straight to the notification center. Through toast notifications, multiple updates can be batched together based on the JupyterLab extension or collaborator. By doing so, the number of notifications will be dramatically decreased. While an integrated notification center allows users to look back on notifications, they might have missed and flag particular notifications for later. To improve the user’s experience, the notification system is customizable for users to choose the types of notifications they prefer to receive and their frequency.
 
“Notify allows users to receive current updates within JupyterLab and stay aware of what their fellow collaborators are working on. Users from all experience levels are now able to easily use our notification center to better communicate with their colleagues.”
